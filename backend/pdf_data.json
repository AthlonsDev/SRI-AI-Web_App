Problem and Need\nThe most recent IPCC climate change report highlights that human-induced climate\nchange has led to more frequent and intense extreme events, consequences of which include\nSustainability 2025, 17,\n2093 https://doi.org/10.3390/su17052093\nSustainability 2025, 17, 2093 2 of 22\nsevere impacts to nature and people [1]. Globally, average precipitation has increased in\nmore locations than decreased [ 1]. Using the UK Climate Projections (UKCP), the Met\nOffice Hadley Centre predicts that in the UK, by 2070 (compared to 1990), winters will be\nbetween 1 and 4.5 ◦C warmer and up to 20–30% wetter [2–4]. Furthermore, it is projected\nthat the intensity of rain will increase by up to 25% in the winter and up to 20% in the\nsummer [4–6].\nThe impacts of flooding are increasing in the UK, impacting health and wellbeing, and\ncausing infrastructure and economic damage [6,7]. Losses from the winter 2019 to 2020\nflooding were estimated to be about £333 million [7]. To reduce these impacts, investment\nis needed in stormwater management systems to cope with the increasing demand [ 8].\nThe traditional approach to addressing urban stormwater management was the creation of\nlarger flood protection infrastructure and increasing capacity in storm drain systems [9],\nknown as grey infrastructure solutions. However, with increasing population density [10]\nand the frequency of extreme rainfall events [2–4], grey infrastructure solutions can rapidly\nbecome overloaded to such an extent that they either fail completely (causing local flooding)\nor overload systems leading to the release of combined stormwater and raw sewage into\nlocal rivers [ 11]. In urban areas, where natural landscapes have largely been replaced\nwith hard impermeable surfaces, the pressures on these grey infrastructure systems can\nbe reduced by replicating natural catchment processes that slow flows and reduce flow\nvolumes [12]. In recent years, natural catchment mimicry approaches to urban stormwater\nmanagement have developed globally following a variety of methodologies including:\nSustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD), and Sponge\nCities [5,13–16]. Natural catchment mimicry approaches can include purely engineering\nsolutions such as rainwater harvesting and storage tanks with flow controls, which are\nfocused on a single, or very narrow range of targeted benefits [16]. They can also include\nblue-green infrastructure (BGI) approaches that have the co-benefits of bringing greenspace\nand nature back into urban areas [17,18]. Such re-naturing approaches have been recognised\nas critical to enhancing the resilience of urban systems [19]. When delivered in a way that\nrestores and enhances biodiversity, provides a range of diverse environmental, social, and\neconomic benefits, and is co-created with local stakeholders to deliver specific outcomes,\nthis concept moves beyond the basics of BGI to represent nature-based solutions (NBS) to\nsocietal challenges [20–23]. Applying such a solutions-based, and multifunctional benefits\ndelivery approach to natural catchment mimicry represents a strong economic argument\nfor bringing nature back into cities [ 24]. Nevertheless, such approaches remain in their\ninfancy compared to their potential [25].\n1.2. Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)\nIn the UK, the predominant emerging approach to stormwater management is sustain-\nable drainage systems (SuDS) [12]. The additionality of SuDS in terms of providing a more\nsustainable solution to manage stormwater and excess surface water than traditional water\nmanagement approaches including providing multiple co-benefits [16,26,27], has also led\nto SuDS emerging as a leading stormwater management approach globally [ 28]. SuDS\ntypically includes a range of different solutions (from nature-inspired to nature-based) in\ncombination as a management train that delivers stormwater management benefits in areas\nof flood risk, and in areas where pressure on existing storm management systems needs to\nbe reduced [16].\nIn addition to water management, SuDS co-benefits have been reported as including\nthe following: conserving and restoring biodiversity [29,30], improving water quality [31],\nand urban cooling [ 32,33]. There is also evidence that SuDS components such as green\nroofs and walls can reduce air pollution [34] as well as noise pollution [35]. Adopting such\nSustainability 2025, 17, 2093 3 of 22\napproaches plays a key role in addressing sustainable development challenges, through\nadapting against the negative impacts of climate change [22,25].\nBeyond the environmental sustainability benefits, SuDS also represent a pathway for\ndriving positive social and economic change [36], for example, by increasing connectedness\nand sense of community [ 36,37], reducing fear of crime [ 38], and improving health and\nmental wellbeing [39]. Economic benefits can result through direct and associated costs\nsavings made as a result of SuDS rainwater management compared to other methods [7].\nThere is also evidence that, if designed appropriately, green infrastructure SuDS can increase\nproperty prices [40], particularly if properties are close to green spaces [ 41], and play a\nrole in working towards a green economy by diversifying income, providing jobs relating\nto green skills, and supporting deprived communities while also being environmentally\nresourceful [42,43].\n1.3. Reported Barriers to SuDS Roll out\nSuDS, and particularly NBS approaches to SuDS, share a common methodological\norigin with other concepts that promote the maintenance, enhancement, and restoration of\nbiodiversity to deliver multifunctional benefits [44]. As such, they also share many of the\nchallenges in relation to the complexity of mainstreaming them into planning and practice.\nThis means that the implementation and mainstreaming of SuDS is limited despite an\nincreasing evidence-base emerging on the potential multifunctional benefits of BGI and\nNBS approaches to climate adaptation in urban areas [45–49]. Several studies have explored\nthe reasons for this with a range of different barriers identified [50]. For example, the role\nof public perceptions and public acceptability of SuDS can be an influencing factor in the\nlikelihood of uptake [51–55]. Public awareness and understanding around the purpose and\nfunction, plant choice and maintenance, and mess and littering are all challenges that can\nplay a role in residents’ acceptance of NBS, including SuDS [51,55]. Urban governance has\nbeen shown to be important in public perceptions of BGI investment [53]. A correlation\nbetween the performance of practices associated with urban BGI for flood management\nand attitudes towards its stewardship has also been identified [56].\nBeyond public perceptions and the public acceptability of urban BGI and NBS ap-\nproaches, a number of complexities and issues have been reported as hindering the growth\nof SuDS. This includes issues around economics, legalities, policy, and logistics [45,57–59].\nEarly work into barriers to SuDS [ 60] categorised barriers within various stages of the\nSuDS implementation processes: pre-application, consultation, decision, and appeal stages.\nMore recently, Deely et al. [61] conducted an extensive literature review and presented\nfive categories of barriers: institutional and governance, socio-cultural, knowledge, techni-\ncal and biophysical, and funding and markets. Whilst this provides a useful framework\nfor exploring SuDS barriers, it does not reveal the impeding factors within the SuDS\nimplementation processes.\nMore details on some of the challenges faced by stakeholders and practitioners have\nbeen presented. A large-scale survey among Australian urban water practitioners explored\nthe premise that risk perceptions can hinder engagement with alternative water systems\n(e.g., stormwater harvesting systems), with factors such as age and years’ experience in\nthe industry influencing risk perceptions [ 62]. Qualitative research among researchers\nand practitioners also from Australia suggests that definitions and clear frameworks and\nmanaging expectations may be useful in uptake and implementation [63]. Further recent\nresearch from Australia highlights six main challenges including finances, innovation and\nevaluation tools, capacity, institutional arrangements, and policy [64].\nDue to the multidisciplinary approach needed for SuDS implementation, achieving\nbuy-in from multiple stakeholders can itself create a challenge [ 65]. Stakeholders can\nSustainability 2025, 17, 2093 4 of 22\nalso be a critical factor in both creating and unlocking SuDS upscaling. Understanding\nperspectives of key stakeholders can help better understand some of the barriers and\nenablers faced by these actors [ 66]. For example, while stakeholders can see challenges\nassociated with urban BGI and NBS (such as installation, financial, biophysical, and socio-\npolitical), they also perceive the benefits (such as managing stormwater, climate change\nadaption, and increased social wellbeing) [ 28]. A UK case study involving a variety of\nstakeholders (local authority, university, and the Environment Agency (the Environment\nAgency is responsible for taking a strategic overview of the management of all sources of\nflooding and coastal erosion (UK Government n.d))) reported that maintenance issues were\nperceived as challenges to the growth of SuDS [65]. This finding is echoed by case study\nwork indicating that maintenance and stewardship are key components to the successful\nlongevity of NBS [47]. SuDS are typically bespoke, and generic approaches are not always\nsuitable for individual localities, presenting further challenges in their implementation and\ndelivery [67].\nInstitutional factors can constrain the implementation of SuDS, namely the lack of\nlegislation, the power of private commercial interests, and the lack of resources in local\nauthorities [67]. Institutional readiness factors can also be limiting; these include strategic\ngoals and institutional fragmentation [59], and prioritization [68] to adopt and upscale BGI\nand NBS approaches for water management. Dorst et al. [ 45] identified three structural\nconditions within that contribute to barriers to urban NBS; they are grouped into regulatory,\nfinancial, and urban development domains. Attempts have also been made to nuance\nbarriers by adding a human dimension into their conceptualization, including attitudi-\nnal barriers (e.g., emotions and beliefs) and contextual barriers (e.g., legal and political\naspects) [69].\n1.4. The Nuance of Actual Barriers Versus Knowledge Barriers\nIn addition to the actual direct barriers presented in the previous section, research has\nshown that while key actors and stakeholders do show interest in NBS/BGI adoption,\nincluding its use in SuDS, lack of knowledge can play a role in preventing uptake [ 25];\nknowledge gaps can include the lack of information on costs (including construction and\nmaintenance), lack of examples and demonstrations, and lack of a framework, as well\nas a lack of financial incentives to support private people and organisations, and a lack\nof knowledge on construction and maintenance costs [\n70]. The lack of knowledge can\npresent in two distinct ways: actual knowledge lacking across the sector related to specific\naspects of SuDS implementation, or knowledge that has been generated, but remains\ninaccessible to specific individuals within the sector. These knowledge gaps can potentially\npresent themselves as indirect barriers to the uptake of alternatives to grey infrastructure\nsolutions [ 44,45,65]. For example, achieving much-needed stakeholder buy-in can be\nundermined by a lack of access to evidence and monitoring of implemented SuDS [65].\nWorkshop research by Kabisch et al. [44] among NBS-related experts identified four\nmain NBS knowledge gaps. These related to (i) the effectiveness of NBS (particularly\nlimited in cities); (ii) relationship between NBS and society (such as place and human–\nnature interactions impacts); (iii) the design of NBS (such as how NBS can integrate with\ngrey infrastructure); and (iv) implementation aspects (such as administrative tools for\nimplementing NBS). Elements of these knowledge gaps are echoed in various research\nstudies. For example, Cotterill and Bracken [ 65] argue that there is a lack of accurate\nperformance data, indicating logistical constraints of installing sensors as the reason. More\nrecently, there has been a call for more information communication around the broader\nbenefits of NBS, specifically the non-tangible benefits of NBS (such as increased recreation\nand well-being), common framing, and communications [68].\nSustainability 2025, 17, 2093 5 of 22\nDorst et al. [ 45] provides further insights into knowledge gaps as challenges within\nurban NBS, including NBS approaches to SuDS mainstreaming, suggesting that a lack\nof knowledge around policy goals related to the potential of urban NBS (e.g., climate\nchange mitigation, economic, and biodiversity benefits) and also a lack of knowledge and\nknowledge exchange on NBS performance (e.g., technical knowledge evidence of benefits)\nare barriers.\nFollowing a systematic literature review and quantitative content analysis, the top\nbarrier for NBS implementation was a lack of expertise and knowledge, with the second\nranked barrier being a lack of evidence on performance and co-benefits [ 71]. This was\nin contrast to the comparison with ‘grey’ solutions implementation (ranked tenth and\neleventh, respectively) [71]. These findings suggested that information and knowledge\ngaps need addressing to facilitate the mainstreaming of NBS approaches to the level of\ntraditional ‘grey’ approaches to water management.\nWhilst there are numerous studies highlighting barriers associated with climate change\nadaption implementation, some of them are conflicting [50]; they tend to be descriptive\nand lack detail and explanation around what causes these barriers [50]. NBS barriers can\nbe interdependent and, to address the complexity of the barriers that exist, it is important\nto acknowledge the interdependencies of challenges [50,72]. A deep understanding of the\nunderlying factors of barriers can help to reduce or remove them, and taking an actor-\ncentred research and comparative approach is needed to better understand these underlying\nbarriers [50]. Such an actor and comparative approach allows for diverse and similar\nbarriers to be explored from different actor perspectives (e.g., those experiencing/managing\nbarriers, including those experiencing common barriers very differently).\n1.5. The Present Study\nWhile previous research offers overviews of barriers to the mainstreaming of SuDS\nand urban NBS, they lack depth and nuance exploring the contrast between practitioners\nwho perceive lots of barriers, and those that do not. This study adopted a mixed-methods\napproach to explore the juxtaposition between direct and indirect barriers from a practi-\ntioner perspective. A survey was used to identify practitioners who perceive high barriers\nand high gaps in knowledge and, by contrast, those that perceived low barriers and low\ngaps in knowledge. A subset of survey respondents with contrasting responses was then\ninterviewed to better understand the varied nuances in perceived barriers to SuDS main-\nstreaming between those perceiving few and those perceiving many. The overall aim of the\nstudy was to identify, explore, and differentiate the nuanced barriers experienced when\ndelivering and mainstreaming SuDS. Specifically, differentiating between barriers linked\nto a lack of access to existing knowledge for certain individuals, and actual barriers faced\nmore universally by SuDS practitioners.\nThe following sections outline the present study, which formed part of a city-wide\nsmall-scale SuDS pilot implementation project scaled-out across London, UK. Section 2\npresents the results of analysis from Phase 1, an online survey among practitioners who\nwere all professionals within the discipline. Section 3 presents the results of the key analysis\nof Phase 2 of the research, which was qualitative interviews with a sub-set of respondents\nto the online survey. Section 4 provides a synthesis of both research perspectives, reflects\non the strengths, limitations, and next steps, and draws insights leading to sector-wide\nrecommendations in relation to SuDS evaluation, knowledge exchange, and priority areas\nfor research.\nSustainability 2025, 17, 2093 6 of 22\n2. Methods\nThe study design comprised a two-phased approach. The objective of the first phase\nwas to explore the diversity of experiences of SuDS implementation across a broad range of\npractitioners. The second phase was to explore in greater depth the contrasting experiences\nof practitioners who perceive many barriers compared to those that perceive very few.\n2.1. Phase 1 Study\n2.1.1. Design and Recruitment\nFor the first phase, a quantitative survey targeted those who work in organisations\n(both public sector and private sector) associated with SuDS implementation. There was\na specific focus on SuDS practitioners (individuals whose organisation roles include a\ncomponent of SuDS planning, delivery, and/or management). The survey was designed\nto give a holistic overview of drivers and barriers experienced by those individuals. This\nincluded a range of questions exploring organization and individual roles, the extent of\ntheir role that involved SuDS implementation, the culture of SuDS in their organisation, and\ntheir experience of SuDS drivers and barriers. The survey options were based on drivers\nand barriers that have been highlighted in previous research. These were supplemented\nwith additional potential drivers and barriers identified by the research team and the\nproject steering group. The steering group comprised a series of individuals involved in the\nmanagement and funding of the London Strategic SuDS Pilot Study—a funded programme\nto unlock the scaling of small-scale SuDS across the Thames catchment in London, UK.\nPotential respondents for the survey were identified through the network of individu-\nals who work with SuDS in and around London (UK), and were known to the research team\nand/or the steering group. The link was shared among this network initially. This network\nwas then used to snowball to direct contacts of the network within their organisations. The\nsurvey included background information about the project and informed consent as per\nUniversity ethics protocols.\n2.1.2. Data Analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to compare the responses. This included a comparison\nof the mean scores for issues perceived to be direct barriers, and those related to lack\nof access to information. IBM SPSS Version 29 was used for statistical analysis. Tests\nof normality were conducted, most variables indicated normal distribution. However,\nbecause not all corresponded to normal distribution, a non-parametric comparative analysis,\nWilcoxon Signed Rank Test, was carried out to statistically compare responses.\n2.2. Phase 2 Study\nThe second phase of the study comprised a series of qualitative semi-structured\ninterviews to explore in greater depth the perceived challenges and opportunities related\nto rolling out SuDS with participants who completed the online survey.\n2.2.1. Design and Recruitment Procedure and Analytical Approach\nAt the end of the Phase 1 survey, respondents were asked to indicate whether they\nwould be interested in taking part in one-to-one interviews. Nineteen survey respondents\nexpressed an interest to take part in the follow-up interviews. Of the nineteen, six respon-\ndents were selected for participation in further interview. The aim of the Phase 2 interviews\nwas to explore the practitioner experience of SuDS implementation from the contrasting\nexperience of practitioners who perceived many barriers to implementation with those that\nexperience few. As such, the sub-sample of respondents selected for Phase 2 interviews was\nnot selected to be representative of the original survey sample population. Instead, it was\nSustainability 2025, 17, 2093 7 of 22\nselected to represent the outliers in terms of responses to the initial surveys. This approach\nwas taken in order to identify those barriers which were experienced by all practitioners\n(direct barriers), and those barriers that were perceived to exist by some, but not by others,\nindicating that they were due to lack of knowledge/experience by some practitioners\n(indirect barriers). This approach inevitably resulted in a small sample size, but the experi-\nential design was such that the quality of experiential information gathered would be more\nvaluable than through a representative sampling approach of all of the respondents.\nDespite the small sample size, follow-up interviewees for the post-survey discussions\ncomprised a diverse range of respondents. This included a variety of organisation types,\nand respondents with contrasting responses to perceived barriers and the availability\nof information questions. All six participants were interviewed (after giving informed\nconsent as per the University’s ethics protocols). They included two individuals from\ndifferent London Borough Councils; two people from non-London councils; one person\nfrom a central government organisation; and one person from a private water company.\nInterviews were conducted online and lasted approximately one hour each.\nThe interviews were broadly framed to explore the responses that the participant had\nindicated in their survey as having high/low barriers to SuDS and a high/low availability\nof information, with discussions focusing on those topics to obtain a deeper understanding\nof those perceptions. This enabled comparative exploration, and better understanding, of\nthe nuanced barriers faced by the diversity of participants.\n2.2.2. Data Analysis\nTo explore the comparative challenges and opportunities experienced by the partic-\nipants related to their SuDS implementation, qualitative analysis was carried out on the\ninterviews. The recordings were transcribed, and the transcripts were analysed using\nthematic analysis, which provided a six-step framework for identifying, analysing, and\nreporting patterns in the data [73]. The initial thematic analysis was carried out by the lead\nauthor, the results of this were then verified by the broader research team.\n3. Results\n3.1. Phase 1 Study\n3.1.1. Participants\nForty-eight people responded to all, or most, of the survey which provided meaningful\ninformation. Most (88%) of the organisations represented by the survey responses came\nfrom the public sector (including water/utility companies, councils). About 8% came from\nthe private sector, with 4% from NGOs. About 80% of survey respondents identified SuDS\nas a core component in their organisation’s role.\nThe survey explored the role of participants in SuDS implementation. Most partic-\nipants felt that finance was applicable to their role (n = 42), with planning (n = 28) and\ndelivery (n = 28) also rated highly in applying to their role. When asked to select the role\naspect of SuDS that was most relevant to their role, most responded to implementation\n(n = 13), with slightly fewer saying it was finance (n = 9), and slightly less involved in the\ndelivery of SuDS (n = 6).\n3.1.2. Survey Measures and Results\nThe survey explored the breadth of experiences of respondents engaged in SuDS work:\nExperience of SuDS implementation. Respondents were asked about their experiences in\nSuDS implementation in terms of planning, delivery, and stewardship. Responses were on a\nfive-point Likert scale: 1 = None at all, 2 = A little, 3 = A moderate amount, 4 = A lot, and\n5 = A great deal. Respondents were most experienced with the planning of SuDS, with\nSustainability 2025, 17, 2093 8 of 22\n40% indicating they had a lot/a great deal of experience of planning, compared to 27%\nexperienced in delivery and 16% experienced in stewardship. This data confirmed the\nsurvey group were indeed professionals with substantial experience in the discipline.\nPerceived organisational support for SuDS. Participants were asked to indicate whether\nthey feel their organisation implements/supports implementation of SuDS widely (yes/no).\nA total of 71% (n = 34) of respondents felt that their organisation did; 29% (n = 13) felt that\ntheir organisation did not.\nPerceptions of mainstreaming of SuDS in their locality. Respondents were asked the extent\nto which SuDS were already mainstreamed in their locality, and also the level they would\nlike to have this mainstreamed. Participants were asked to provide a response on a Likert\nscale: 1 = Definitely not, 2 = Probably not, 3 = Maybe yes/maybe no, 4 = Probably yes,\nand 5 = Definitely yes. Most participants (98%) agreed that that they would like more\nwidespread delivery of SuDS in their locality, with 92% of those agreeing responding\n‘definitely yes’ and 6% stating ‘probably yes’. A total of 2% responded to ‘probably not’ and\n2% did not respond to this question. Around one-third (36%) felt that SuDS are currently\nbeing mainstreamed in their locality, with slightly more (40%) feeling that they were not.\nAround a quarter (23%) were ambivalent to this.\nPerceptions of main benefits, co-benefits, and gaps in information. Respondents were asked\nwhat they perceived as key drivers. Examples included air quality, biodiversity and ecology,\ncommunity cohesion and crime reduction, and drainage. Respondents were presented\nwith three response options per driver and asked to indicate whether they perceived the\ndriver as (a) a main (targeted) benefit to implement SuDS; (b) whether it is a co-benefit\n(an additional benefit, but not a key driver); or (c) whether they are unsure and that they\nwould like more information available to them about it. A visual representation is shown\nin Figure 1, in order of main benefit first.\nThe top five main benefits of SuDS were perceived to be (1) drainage (95.7% of\nrespondents); (2) flood risk reduction (91.1%); (3) climate change adaptation (85.1%);\n(4) water quality (56.5%); and (5) biodiversity and ecology (50%).\nThe top five main co-benefits of SuDS were perceived to be (1) air and building tem-\nperature (79.5%); (2) air quality (76.7%); (3) recreation (70.5%); (4) education opportunities\n(70.5%); and (5) health and well-being (69.8%)\nThe top five benefits respondents highlighted uncertainty and the need for further\ninformation for were (1) economic growth and inward investment (33.3%); (2) community\ncohesion and crime reduction (31.8%); (3) improving company profile (25.6%); (4) air quality\n(20.9%); and (4) carbon reduction and sequestration (18.2%).\nPerceived barriers and information availability. Respondents were asked about perceived\nbarriers and issues relating to information availability with regards to implementing SuDS\n(Figure 2). They were presented with a list of potential barriers. Respondents were asked\nto respond to whether each was a barrier, and if the barrier related to a lack of available\ninformation. These responses were presented as a drop-down menu with a 1–5 scale.

Phase 2 Study\n3.2.1. Interview Findings\nThree overarching themes captured the recurring and salient topics within the inter-\nview data: (i) people-related elements associated with SuDS; (ii) Limiting practicalities\nassociated with SuDS; and (iii) informational factors. Each of the broad themes also com-\nprised subthemes. The recurring themes and subthemes across participants are summarised\nin Table 2. These themes were supported with a selection of accompanying verbatim ex-\ntracts from the interviews. To assure organisation anonymity of those taking part, any\norganisation names which are attached to the participants have been excluded and replaced\nwith ORGANISATION, location names have been replaced with PLACE, and individual\npeople identified have been replaced with NAME.\nTable 2. Summary of themes and subthemes identified within interviews.\nThemes Subthemes\n1. People-related elements associated\nwith SuDS\n– Attitudes and perceptions\n– Skills and expertise\n– Collaborations\n– The public\n2. Limiting practicalities associated\nwith SuDS\n– Physical limitations\n– Funding limitations\n– Timing limitations\n3. Informational factors\n– Available information\n– Understanding the information\n– Lack of transferable knowledge models\nPeople-Related Elements Associated with SuDS\nThe involvement of different actors was identified as key throughout the different\nphases of SuDS implementation and scaling, with a specific focus on the varied disciplines\nand roles in the process of developing and delivering SuDS This included roles internal\nto the organization and those external. How required participants can vary dependent on\nproject context (e.g., in relation to implementation location: schools, scout huts, cemeteries,\nthe NHS, etc.) was also raised. Barriers and opportunities related to this are aligned with\nthe subthemes: attitudes and perceptions; skills and expertise; collaborative difficulties;\nand public attitudes.\nAttitudes and Perceptions\nGenerally, participants felt that SuDS were being seen as more common within their\norganisations and more common compared to a few years ago. Despite this, there was a\nsense of still some way to go. Participants identified attitudes of people to SuDS, particularly\ninternally, as key to whether the organisation generally, or projects specifically, would be\nseen as a priority. Having someone internally, particularly in a powerful position with\ninfluence within an organisation, was seen as key to making a difference to the approach\nof the organization, and driving a positive and supportive attitude in an organization\ntowards SuDS. Such an organizational switch was seen as a critical step to an organization\nprioritizing funding for SuDS initiatives.\nSustainability 2025, 17, 2093 13 of 22\nConversely, having people within organisations or on project-specific teams who do\nnot have a positive attitude towards SuDS, was reported as a barrier to the growth of SuDS\nas a whole. For example, the below interview extract describes how working with someone\nwho perhaps did not have a positive attitude towards SuDS impacted their ability to deliver\non the SuDS project.\n“I think the first person [on the project] had been delivering a kind of traditional grey\ninfrastructure for a very long time, and was getting towards the end of their career and\nhad a proficient track record and rightly so you know that the kind of standard drainage\nwould work. Yeah, we know that works as it’s been installed for 150 years or something,\nbut wasn’t convinced with the concept of SuDS. Whereas the second person [who later\njoined the project] had experiences of it being delivered successfully, and had seen that it\nworked, so they were willing to put in the extra effort and work with us to make it work.”\n(Participant 1)\nThere was also a barrier identified in relation to knowledge stagnation that may be\ncontributing to an inertia of SuDS development, and a need to change messaging to drive\nforward mainstreaming.\n“You know, there’s a whole fundamental shift change that’s needed to attitudes with\nregards to getting this in. And it really frustrates me that I can go to presentations at\nconferences and it’s the same stuff from 10 years ago\n. . .but SuDS are still sold as new\nand innovative.” (Participant 3)\nSkills and Expertise\nHaving the necessary skills and expertise in a SuDS delivery team was identified as a\nkey need. Participants identified that SuDS require multidisciplinary skills and expertise,\nand that this can be challenging to provide in a single team. Having, or lacking, these skills\nand expertise was seen as a key factor for determining the success of mainstreaming SuDS.\nHaving a core in-house team of people with expert knowledge was seen as advantageous in\nterms of SuDS as this provides a strong foundation for reacting to funding opportunities. A\nparticular risk that was identified was skills and expertise being held by a single individual\nin an organization. This highlighted the importance of both staff retention and development\nto retain staff with experience and expertise. It was also identified that some of the staff\nretention and development problems could be related to management attitudes.\n“London borough ORGANISATION retained an in-house team of engineers [. . .] rather\nthan outsourcing it to consultants. So, ORGANISATION was in a fairly fortunate\nposition when the flood water management came in that we already had this core of\nengineers with local knowledge or local expertise and understanding of what the flooding\nand drainage problems were.” (Participant 5)\n“Some managers are quite proactive and wishing to see their team skills developed and\ntheir employees develop. Other managers are more concerned if they start to go down\nthat road that they are encouraging their staff members to leave. Who doesn’t want to get\nbetter then to go on and take those skills elsewhere.” (Participant 3)\nExamples of solutions and schemes contributing towards developing and retaining\nexpertise were identified. For example, a scheme that employs a graduate for five years.\nOver those five years, there is guaranteed training and development, and if they progress\nthough this and obtain a Master’s degree as part of the process, they are guaranteed to\nmove up two employment grades by the end of the five years. The aim is to create fully\nqualified engineers that are professionally and financially satisfied with their progress and\nmore likely to stay on.\nSustainability 2025, 17, 2093 14 of 22\nCollaborations\nInternal and external collaboration was seen as an important driver of SuDS due to\nthe interdisciplinary nature throughout the conceptualisation, implementation, and legacy\nphases. Collaboration as a theme complements the skills and expertise theme by bringing\nadditional expert knowledge to delivery teams. This can also represent a pathway for\nbringing new knowledge and ideas into in-house teams.\n“If you try to do everything in-house, [. . .] there might [. . .] be a risk of stagnation, you\nwouldn’t actually be exposed to enough new ideas.” (Participant 5)\nCollaboration is particularly important for exploiting emerging opportunities. For\nexample, if work and disruption are needed for one reason (e.g., road works) it may present\nan opportunity for other simultaneous works (e.g., SuDS). Working in an isolated and\nfragmented (siloed) way may mean that such opportunities are missed. Collaboration,\ndone formally or informally, can mean that opportunities are not missed. The interviews\nprovided insights into how collaborations can be achieved:\n“[Before Covid] We did used to invite people to the entire team meeting [. . .] once in a\nwhile. The first half an hour would be for a manager or senior member of another team to\ncome in and talk to us about what they do and we can form those relationships, talk about\nwhat we all get up to and where we can help each other out.” (Participant 3)\nThe Public\nThe role of the public, public engagement, and public attitudes was also acknowledged\nbut the extent that this was seen as a barrier varied. Generally, there was consensus that\npublic understanding of, and interest in, flooding risk and SuDS related to their own direct\nexperience (i.e., either having been flooded, or experiencing disruption and/or cost related\nto SuDS). Communications around SuDS were identified as not strong enough and a need\nfor more SuDS education was highlighted as a more general need, rather than currently\nwhere this only occurs locally related to a specific SuDS scheme. Corresponding with the\nsurvey results, participants did not identify public perception as being a particular barrier\nto mainstreaming SuDS.\nThe communication of the co-benefits of SuDS (e.g., health and wellbeing, traffic\ncalming, etc.) was identified as a way to obtain greater public engagement, as these\nmay be issues they are more engaged in than flooding, particularly if they have not\nexperienced flooding:\n“We’d sell them more as kind of a wider kind of public realm improvement greening up,\nhelping to improve air quality, make them nicer places, improve health and wellbeing, calm\ntraffic. [\n. . .] Including such an element of those types of projects helps to sell them because\nthen people can then see, usually that they’re hoping to deliver kind of environmental\nbenefit as well.” (Participant 5)\nIt was acknowledged that building relationships with the public was important. Par-\nticipants identified public engagement and communication conducted by an external\norganization, rather than directly from the council, as a mechanism to reduce barriers. The\nthird-party organisation was seen as a buffer, to ensure engagement focused on the SuDS\nproject, rather than spilling over into broader council issues.\n3.2.2. Limiting Practicalities Associated with SuDS\nThe second theme related to more practical aspects that can represent barriers to SuDS:\nphysical limitations, funding limitations, and timing limitations.\nSustainability 2025, 17, 2093 15 of 22\nPhysical Limitations\nPhysical challenges can represent a barrier to implementing SuDS, particularly in\nurban areas, and in relation to local and regional area boundaries. This included the\nchallenges of working on congested streets with lots of buried utilities, and multiple\nother considerations., and the challenges of regional boundaries not corresponding with\nwatershed boundaries.\nPhysical limitations were identified as a barrier for both retrofit and new developments.\nThis was seen as a planning issue that could be avoided with early consideration. Typically,\nSuDS were described as an afterthought after master planning:\n“this is where the building is going to be” [. . .], “OK, how are we gonna fit in managing\nwater around it?” “Oh, now we’re constrained by levels because we can’t put our storage\nat the top of a hill.” (Participant 6)\nFunding Limitations\nParticipants identified barriers in relation to sources of funding. One participant\nbroadly indicated there are two broad types of funding—internal funding or external\nfunding (third party, e.g., from water companies, local government, regional development\nfunding, and the Department for Education). Accessing funding, both capital and main-\ntenance, was a commonly cited barrier to mainstreaming SuDS. Maintenance costs and\nownership were particularly highlighted as problematic, including having the knowledge\nand tools to be able to maintain SuDS.\n“I think a big barrier to the rain garden project involvement was concerns over mainte-\nnance. Without having got the right equipment do we know what to do or it’s a bit more\nthan just cutting the grass where we don’t know how to do that? Who’s gonna [. . .] take\nresponsibility for that? That’s always a problem, right? [. . .] Reluctance to try something\nnew because of the worry about how you look after it.” (Participant 6)\nIn parallel to this concept of risk related to a lack of experience of maintenance, another\nindirect finance-related risk included political risk related to public trust in a local authority.\nThere was an indication that investment in SuDS was not necessarily a barrier per se, but\nthe political risk of a bad investment in SuDS (i.e., SuDS projects being invested in but not\nhappening) was a funding barrier:\n“Those risks are often not actual pure financial risks because [ . . .] it’s rare to waste\nsignificant amounts of money on the project. That doesn’t happen. It’s more of potential\npolitical risk if you say you’re going to do something.” (Participant 5)\nTiming Limitations\nTime cycles and the timing of SuDS was also seen as problematic, and perceived as\nlengthy in terms of lead-in and completion time. This was particularly highlighted in\nrelation to the five-year AMP (an asset management plan (AMP) period is a five-year time\nperiod used in the English and Welsh water industry in the UK) cycle, and the fact that,\nif there is no available funding in the current plan, then there would be a long duration\nbefore new funding could be ring-fenced.\nTiming was also raised as an issue related to theme one and the challenge of retaining\nin-house expertise over the long duration that some SuDS projects can take from conceptu-\nalization to completion and maintenance. Timing was also recognized as critical in relation\nto ensuring that initial secured funding continues at least into the first few years of the\nmaintenance phase of a project to prevent a lack of maintenance funding being a barrier\nto delivery:\nSustainability 2025, 17, 2093 16 of 22\n“we have to [. . .] do a sort of sleight of hand to convert some of it, if possible, into surplus\nto come in the future, [. . .] call it commuted sums, but it may not be permitted by the\nfunding criteria. [. . .] So either allow the use of their funding for maintenance, or if they\ncould require very tight sort of maintenance funds to be set aside, you know? You know\nso that people like me don’t have to argue for, it’s just a given.” (Participant 4)\n3.2.3. Informational Factors\nThe third broad theme identified was perceived informational challenges around\nSuDS. This included subthemes of available information, understanding the information,\nand a lack of transferable knowledge models.\nAvailable Information\nParticipants stated that there is a good amount of general information available on\nSuDS compared to a decade ago. However, they also stated that improvements were\nstill needed, particularly in terms of updating available information as the sector has\ndeveloped. A lack of widespread distribution of information was also highlighted as a\nbarrier, particularly the lack of integration of SuDS information into other policies, such as\nplace-making and climate policy, to mainstream it.\nSpecific information around monitoring data was a topic that lacked consensus. Some\nperceived a lack of monitoring data, but others stated that sufficient data was available\non short-term performance, and that it was only long-term performance data and scaled\nperformance data that were missing.\n“I really think we need some of these longer-term studies with different types of SuDS\nmeasures—with different levels of maintenance as well, to see exactly what they’re gonna\ndo because they really need to stack up against grey solutions.” (Participant 1)\n“There needs to be lots of proof of concept at scale with monitoring so you can actually\nsay that you know this thing is genuinely stopped that amount of water going in that\npipe under these storm conditions and the models support it, and then we could start to\nmove things forward.” (Participant 2)\nUnderstanding the Information\nAnother issue identified was how understandable and actionable the information\nthat could be accessed was. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of SuDS, understanding\ninformation that is provided to help unlock barriers to implementation may require a broad\nknowledge-base and ability to discuss with others in the field, which is not always possible:\n“They would be there [. . .] one afternoon a week to provide their planning officers with\nsome guidance, [. . .] just to be someone there to ask questions to [. . .] better equip them\nwith the information to be confident.” (Participant 6)\nLack of Transferable Knowledge Models\nTo mainstream SuDS, developing transferrable conceptual, practical, financial, and\ninformational models was identified as a sector need.\n“It’s about [. . .] taking that and making it into a sausage machine where you can just keep\nchurning these things through or, if next time you’re not that interested in SuDS, you’re\ninterested more in green walls—the special purpose vehicle structure and the contracting\nand how some of the contributions will be different, but they can just be done again.”\n(Participant 2)\n“What we’re trying to do is [. . .] source some capital funding [. . .] so that we can build\na pipeline of projects on the shelf. [ . . .] get them to the point of going out to tender for\nSustainability 2025, 17, 2093 17 of 22\na contractors etc. and keep on the shelf so [. . .] we can just go look for at least one that\nwould fit your criteria.” (Participant 3)\n4. General Discussion\n4.1. Synthesis of Survey and Interview Findings\nThe mixed-methodological approach to investigating practitioner perceptions of SuDS\nbarriers and knowledge enabled a high-level review of current general perceptions and\nmore detailed nuance in relation to contrasting practitioner experiences.\nBroadly, our results corresponded to previous studies in relation to perceived benefits\nof SuDS [25,30,31]. Reported barriers also mirrored those reported previously, including\nattitudinal barriers and contextual constraints [69], and economics, legalities, policy, and\nlogistics [45,57–59]. Our study identified public perceptions as not being a barrier per se,\nwhich contrasts previous research [51,55]. Instead, this study highlighted attitudes towards\nSuDS stewardship as a barrier [51,55,56], perhaps reflecting a shift in public opinion. Cor-\nresponding with other studies, institutional factors, including attitudes and prioritisation\nwithin organisations [59,68] were also identified as key barriers to mainstreaming SuDS.\nAdditional barriers identified in this study also correspond with those reported in some\nprevious studies: governance, socio-cultural, knowledge, technical and biophysical, and\nfunding and markets [61].\nThe actor-centred participatory process adopted in this study also highlighted that an\nimprovement is still needed in cross-departmental communication among both internal\nand external agents due to the multiple skillsets that are required when working with SuDS.\nThis study advanced previous understanding by taking a comparative approach to\nits actor-centred research, (as encouraged by [50]), exploring the nuance of the reported\nbarriers and issues of information availability, accessibility, and usability [74].\nThe comparative assessment of barriers to SuDS implementation mainstreaming identi-\nfies both direct barriers and indirect barriers. Direct barriers are those that can be categorised\nas hard barriers, such as practical technical limitations due to local context, and lacking or\ninappropriate funding. They also include gaps within SuDS data and broad knowledge\n(e.g., discipline knowledge gaps) that need to be addressed through further research and\nmonitoring. Indirect barriers, by contrast, were identified as soft barriers, including indi-\nvidual practitioner knowledge and capacity gaps through a lack of access to training and\ndevelopment, and the inaccessibility of key SuDS knowledge to all practitioners. It was\nfound that barriers could be both direct and indirect. For example, funding limitations were\ndirect barriers (when insufficient and/or unsuitable funding was available) and indirect\nbarriers (a lack of the transfer of knowledge on how to access the funds that are suitable and\navailable, and how to use them creatively). The quantitative findings identified a general\ncorrelation between increasing information available and decreasing the perception of\nbarriers by practitioners. The qualitative research highlighted the importance of knowledge\nexchange for increasing information availability and, particularly, sharing experiential\nlearning across practitioner networks. Practitioner to practitioner sharing has the potential\nto address direct and indirect barriers, driving forward sector-wide change beyond just an\nindividual knowledge level.\nThese findings correspond with previous studies’ identified knowledge gaps around\nSuDS and the barriers that this creates [44,45,61,65,68] and that actor networks are a key\ncomponent to supporting some practitioners to overcome many of these barriers [66].\nDespite this acknowledgement that some barriers relate to poor practices in relation to\nthe sharing of experiential knowledge, the study clearly identified areas where sector-wide\ninformation gaps remain, particularly relating to long-term performance data. Participants\nalso highlighted challenges in relation to developing and retaining in-house expertise in a\nSustainability 2025, 17, 2093 18 of 22\nrapidly evolving sector. Mirroring the findings of [72], the study also found that barriers\nwere interrelated to a greater or lesser degree.\nThis study builds on previous findings by adding depth to the current understanding\nof perceived and experienced barriers, and adding nuance to the understanding of the\nbalance between direct and indirect barriers. The study has highlighted direct factors that\nare currently limiting the sector-wide mainstreaming of SuDS, and confounding indirect\nfactors (such as a lack of effective knowledge transfer between the relevant actors key to\nSuDS implementation), that create limitations on an individual/local basis.\n4.2. Strengths, Weaknesses, and Future Research\nAddressing a need identified in BGI/NBS literature [50], this study increased under-\nstanding of the perceptions of people who work in organisations relevant to the planning,\ndelivery, and stewardship of SuDS. The mixed-methods approach enabled greater inter-\nrogation of the understanding generated by the initial online survey results, providing a\njuxtaposition between those who experience numerous barriers and those that have found\nways to navigate many of these. It was clear from the interviews that, for those participants\nwho perceive many barriers, improving and updating knowledge transfer from successful\nand challenging case studies would be of immense value. Whilst this study was only\nfocused on London, UK, and therefore numbers are relatively low, many of the outcomes\nwould be expected to be transferable to other urban areas globally. To fully understand this\ntransferability nationally and globally, replication across other study areas and participants\nwould be valuable. Also, a larger sample size for the quantitative work would increase the\npower in the statistical analysis and the representativeness of practitioner experiences in\ndifferent contexts.\n4.3. Conclusions\nAn overarching recommendation for actors in governmental and SuDS-based organ-\nisations relevant to water management is to work openly and collaboratively to share\nexperiential learning. This must include both successes and failures in SuDS implementa-\ntion. It is of particular importance to capture and share this knowledge from individuals\nwith the greatest track records (and thus least perceived barriers). Such knowledge transfer\ncan help to unlock the indirect, soft, knowledge and awareness barriers still faced by many\npractitioners. Specific recommendations to address both the direct and indirect barriers\ninclude the following:\n• National government and centralised SuDS-based organisations should prioritise\ncapturing and making available the data from the long-term monitoring of the envi-\nronmental, social, and economic performance of SuDS to address gaps in knowledge\naround long-term data.\n• Local authorities should engage with organisations who are maintaining SuDS to\nprovide a collaborative approach to understanding the effects of different maintenance\napproaches on the long-term performance of SuDS.\n• National and local governments should make SuDS more inclusive within their policy\nframeworks to enable the awareness and implementation of SuDS. This should include\nembedding SuDS concepts into wider environmental policies.\n• Local authorities, water companies, and the national curriculum should work towards\nincreasing public awareness and understanding of SuDS through the provision of\nSuDS information and education more generally.\n• Organisations need to attract and retain SuDS expertise. This can be improved\nby establishing career opportunities/progression and training linked to SuDS\nwithin organisations.\nSustainability 2025, 17, 2093 19 of 22\n• Organisations can develop informal associations and knowledge exchange processes\nwithin their own workplaces (e.g., coffee mornings, invited guest talks into other\ninternal meetings, setting up a regular internal seminar programme, or other informal\nknowledge exchange networks).\n• Governments and water operators should offer more openly accessible water knowl-\nedge networks to facilitative informal and formal peer-to-peer networks.\n• Case studies developed for knowledge exchange should include more of the ‘how’\nand less of the ‘what’ in order to support the development of a community of practice.\n• National government should develop (based on good practice case studies) standard-\nised financial planning of SuDS schemes to include a period of maintenance funding\nincorporated into the initial capital funding.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.C.; Methodology, H.H. and S.C.; Formal analysis, H.H.;\nInvestigation, H.H. and J.B.; Data curation, H.H.; Writing—original draft, H.H., J.B. and S.C.; Writing—\nreview & editing, H.H. and S.C.; Project administration, S.C.; Funding acquisition, S.C.
